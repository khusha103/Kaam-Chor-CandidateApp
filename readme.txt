Angular forms basics: FormGroup, FormControl and FormBuilder
As we mentioned before, we are going to use Angular reactive forms in this example app.
 These are the basic concepts you need to grasp before we start.

1)FormControl: it tracks the value and validity status of an Angular form control. 
It matches to an HTML form control such as an input or a selector.

This basic example shows a FormControl for the name property which should not be empty.

ts file:
this.name = new FormControl('Dayana', Validators.required)

html file:
<ion-input type="text" formControlName="name"></ion-input>

2)FormGroup: it tracks the value and validity state of a FormBuilder instance group. 
It aggregates the values of each child FormControl into one object, with each form control name as the key.
 Furthermore, it calculates its status by reducing the statuses of its children.
  For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire group becomes invalid. For example:

this.user = new FormGroup({
 name: new FormControl('Dayana', Validators.required),
 country: new FormControl('Uruguay', Validators.required)
});


3)FormBuilder: is a helper class that creates FormGroup, FormControl and FormArray instances for us.
 It basically reduces the repetition and clutter by handling details of form control creation for you.

this.validations_form = this.formBuilder.group({
  name: new FormControl('', Validators.required),
  email: new FormControl('', Validators.compose([
    Validators.required,
    Validators.pattern('^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$')
  ]))
});

A `FormArray` instance in Angular's Reactive Forms is particularly useful for managing dynamic forms where the number of controls can change at runtime. Here are some key points about where and how to use `FormArray`:

The safe navigation operator (?.), also known as the optional chaining operator, is a feature in TypeScript (and JavaScript) that allows you to safely access deeply 
nested properties of an object without having to explicitly check if each reference in the chain is null or undefined.
 This operator helps prevent runtime errors that occur when you try to access properties of null or undefined objects.
 
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  address: {
    city: 'Wonderland'
  }
};

// Accessing a nested property safely
const city = user.address?.city; // 'Wonderland'
const zipCode = user.address?.zipCode; // undefined (no error thrown)

If your form contains multiple file upload fields, you need to handle each file input separately without binding them directly to Angular's form controls. You can achieve this by managing each file input individually and appending each file to the `FormData` object.

Hereâ€™s how you can manage multiple file uploads:

### Component Changes

1. **Add Separate Variables for Each File Input:**

   Define separate variables for each file and handle each file input change event independently.

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
   import { ApiService } from '../../services/api.service'; // Adjust the path as necessary

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-upload',
     templateUrl: './upload.page.html',
     styleUrls: ['./upload.page.scss'],
   })
   export class UploadPage {
     uploadForm: FormGroup;
     file1: File | null = null;
     file2: File | null = null;

     constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder, private apiService: ApiService) {
       this.uploadForm = this.formBuilder.group({
         // Other form controls if needed
       });
     }

     onFileChange(event: Event, fileType: string) {
       const input = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
       if (input.files && input.files.length) {
         if (fileType === 'file1') {
           this.file1 = input.files[0];
         } else if (fileType === 'file2') {
           this.file2 = input.files[0];
         }
       }
     }

     onSubmit() {
       if (this.file1 || this.file2) {
         const formData = new FormData();

         if (this.file1) {
           formData.append('file1', this.file1);
         }
         if (this.file2) {
           formData.append('file2', this.file2);
         }

         // Adding a constant value
         const additionalValue = 'someConstantValue';
         formData.append('additionalKey', additionalValue);

         this.apiService.uploadFile(formData).subscribe(
           response => console.log('Upload successful!', response),
           error => console.error('Error uploading file:', error)
         );
       } else {
         console.error('No files selected');
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Handle Multiple File Inputs in the HTML Template:**

   Use distinct `change` event handlers for each file input.

   ```html
   <ion-header [translucent]="true">
     <ion-toolbar>
       <ion-title>upload</ion-title>
     </ion-toolbar>
   </ion-header>

   <ion-content>
     <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
       <ion-item>
         <ion-label position="stacked">Select File 1</ion-label>
         <input type="file" (change)="onFileChange($event, 'file1')" />
       </ion-item>

       <ion-item>
         <ion-label position="stacked">Select File 2</ion-label>
         <input type="file" (change)="onFileChange($event, 'file2')" />
       </ion-item>

       <ion-button type="submit" [disabled]="!file1 && !file2">Upload</ion-button>
     </form>
   </ion-content>
   ```

### Explanation

1. **Separate Variables for Each File:**
   - `file1` and `file2` are used to store the files selected from each respective file input.
   
2. **Handling File Changes:**
   - The `onFileChange` method now takes an additional `fileType` parameter to determine which file input is being processed.
   - The files are stored in the respective variables based on the `fileType`.

3. **Form Submission:**
   - In the `onSubmit` method, check if the files exist and append them to the `FormData` object with appropriate keys (`file1` and `file2`).

4. **HTML Template:**
   - Each file input triggers the `onFileChange` method with a specific `fileType` to distinguish between them.

### Summary

By managing each file input separately and using distinct form control variables, you can handle multiple file 
uploads efficiently without running into issues with programmatically setting file input values. This approach 
ensures that you can upload multiple files with different keys in a single request.

To deploy an Ionic project on a cPanel server, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Build Your Ionic Project

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to your Ionic project directory.

2. **Run the build command** to create a production-ready version of your app:

   ```bash
   ionic build --prod
   ```

   This command generates the necessary files in the `www` directory of your Ionic project.

### Step 2: Prepare the Files for Upload

1. **Locate the `www` folder** in your project directory. This folder contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets needed for your app.

2. **Compress the `www` folder** into a `.zip` file. This will make it easier to upload all the necessary files at once.

### Step 3: Access cPanel

1. **Log in to your cPanel account** provided by your web hosting service.

2. Navigate to the **File Manager** section.

### Step 4: Upload the Files

1. In the File Manager, navigate to the directory where you want to host your Ionic app. This is usually the `public_html` directory.

2. **Upload the `.zip` file** containing your `www` folder. You can do this by clicking the "Upload" button in the File Manager.

3. Once the upload is complete, **extract the `.zip` file**. This will create a folder containing all your app files.

### Step 5: Configure the Application

1. **Ensure the main entry point** is set correctly. If your app uses the default `index.html` file, it should be in the root of your public directory.

2. If your Ionic app uses routing, ensure that the `.htaccess` file is configured to handle client-side routing. You can create or edit the `.htaccess` file in your `public_html` directory with the following content:

   ```apache
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
       RewriteEngine On
       RewriteBase /
       RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
       RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   </IfModule>
   ```

### Step 6: Test Your Application

1. **Open your web browser** and navigate to your domain (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`).

2. Your Ionic app should now be live. Test the functionality to ensure everything is working as expected.

### Additional Notes

- **CORS Issues**: If your app makes API calls to a different domain, ensure that the server handling those API requests has CORS enabled.

- **SSL Configuration**: If your domain uses HTTPS, ensure that your cPanel is configured to support SSL.

- **Debugging**: If you encounter issues, use the browser's developer tools to inspect errors and troubleshoot.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy your Ionic project on a cPanel server. If you have any specific questions or run into issues during the process, feel free to ask!
